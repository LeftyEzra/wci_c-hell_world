1.    PREPROCESSOR : a software program that processs every written/entered datas or program tol that instructs the compiler to do thorough checks
for errors and correct them before compiling or print the input datas to output.
  Preprocessors helps in comments removals, file addition, and conditional compilation.

      COMPILATION PROCESS: This is the transfer of human readable code into a machine readable format.
Compilation process involves pre-processing, compiling, assembling, linking and  running the excutable(.exe) file to get an output.      
  
  PREPROCESSORS: *In C language, pre-processors tells compiler to look for #symbols like #include(header files), #define(defining  values) and the likes to process. 
   Comments removal like, (/**/). 
   File addition like #include <stdio.h> <stdlib.h> in C.
   Conditional statements if, elseif, elif, else....*  
  2. COMPILING: Translator the software that tramslate both the source code and machine code.
  3. Assembling
  4. Linking
  5. Executable
